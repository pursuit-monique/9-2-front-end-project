# A project to track historical Earthquake data by date and year.


-- This user is into Environmental Studies, yet Environmental maps are often static.

-- You can find up to date Earthquake maps, but not historical data with links for information for research.

-- Possible usages aside researches = the ability to quickly cross reference what type of rock the land is comprised of (Ignius etc) and how often Earthquakes occur.

#  Using:
-- **Leaflet.js** https://leafletjs.com/reference.html#geojson
-- **Earthquake catalog** https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/
